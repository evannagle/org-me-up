* Where am I?

Hi, there. Welcome to Org-Me-Up. These are cliffnotes on org-roids. Learn about anything. Mostly nerdy anythings. Then, forget about everything, and refer back to your notes.

*** Installing Org-Me-Up

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# step 1: clone me
git clone git@github.com:evannagle/org-me-up.git

# step 2: spend 14 years learning Emacs and Emacs org mode
open "https://orgmode.org/"

# step 3: come back when your jeans are silken, and pick a tome:
ls org-me-up/notes | grep awk 

emacs org-me-up/the-awk-programming-language/readme.org
#+END_SRC

*** How Do I Contribute?

Interested in contributing? Why, you kind traveller! Here's how:

1. Fork this repo.
2. Run this script:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; if you add this file to your config,
;; you can call M-x org-me-up/make-book
;; until the cows come home
(load-file "./scripts/make-book.el")
#+END_SRC

3. Start taking notes.
4. Make sure to follow the hackneyed citation style, and tag your books for easy lookup.
5. Update this main readme once you're at least partially finished.
6. Submit a pull request to get your book added to the main branch. Or, horde your learnings like a lemming.

From wanderer to wanderer, priorities vary vastly. Ask my wife, for example. Feel free to ignore or reset these priorities to meet your own esoteric predilections.

| *#A*     | This book is a must-read. Donald Knuth probably wrote it.                                                                                       |

| *#C*     | These are books that are interesting and will provide some tangentially powerful tools. Read these if you need some time away from your family. |
| *#D*     | These are somewhat esoteric books that are fun to read.                                                                                         |
| *#E*     | These are somewhat esoteric books that have hemorrhaged all of their value. Read these if you hate yourself.                                    |
