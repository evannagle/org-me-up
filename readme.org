* Org Me Up!
** Where am I?

Hi, there. Welcome to Org-Me-Up. These are cliffnotes on org-roids. Learn about anything. Mostly nerdy anythings. Then, forget about everything, and refer back to your notes.

*** Installing Org-Me-Up

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# step 1: clone me
git clone git@github.com:evannagle/org-me-up.git

# step 2: spend 14 years learning Emacs and Emacs org mode
open "https://orgmode.org/"

# step 3: come back when your jeans are silken, and pick a tome:
ls org-me-up/notes | grep awk 

emacs org-me-up/the-awk-programming-language/readme.org
#+END_SRC

*** How Do I Contribute?

Interested in contributing? Why, you kind traveller! Here's how:

1. Fork this repo.
2. Add a PDF of the book to the [[file+emacs:books/][books/]] folder. Make sure you name the PDF file snakily (e.g. books/practical-common-lisp.pdf).
3. Add your org-based book notes to the [[emacs%2Bfile:notes/][notes/]] folder. Take a peak at another set of notes to get an idea for how things work around here.
4. Link to your book in the /library/ section of this document.
5. Make sure to follow the hackneyed citation style, and tag your books for easy lookup.

** Prioritizing

From wanderer to wanderer, priorities vary vastly. Ask my wife, for example. Feel free to ignore or reset these priorities to meet your own esoteric predilections.

| *#A*     | This book is a must-read. Donald Knuth probably wrote it.                                                                                       |
| *#B*     | These are books that provide fundamental information on a given topic.                                                                          |
| *#C*     | These are books that are interesting and will provide some tangentially powerful tools. Read these if you need some time away from your family. |
| *#D*     | These are somewhat esoteric books that are fun to read.                                                                                         |
| *#E*     | These are somewhat esoteric books that have hemorrhaged all of their value. Read these if you hate yourself.                                    |

** The Library

If you're underwhelmed, please come back in twenty years. By then, my kids will be in college, and I'll have more time to fine-tune my own derelict personal pursuits.
