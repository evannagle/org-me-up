From wanderer to wanderer, priorities vary vastly. Ask my wife, for example. Feel free to ignore or reset these priorities to meet your own esoteric predilections.

| *#A*     | This book is a must-read. Donald Knuth probably wrote it.                                                                                       |

| *#C*     | These are books that are interesting and will provide some tangentially powerful tools. Read these if you need some time away from your family. |
| *#D*     | These are somewhat esoteric books that are fun to read.                                                                                         |
| *#E*     | These are somewhat esoteric books that have hemorrhaged all of their value. Read these if you hate yourself.                                    |
