* The Vim Way
** Basic commands
*** . = repeat last command
*** x = delete char
*** x.. = delete three chars
*** 3x = delete three 
*** 3x. = delete six chars
*** dd = delete line   
*** >G = increase indentation from current line to EOF 
*** a = append, A = append at end of line

** Some compound commands

   |----------+-------+-----------------------------|
   | Compound | Long  | Description                 |
   |----------+-------+-----------------------------|
   | C        | c$    | Change to EOL               |
   | s        | cl    | Substitute letter           |
   | S        | ^C    | Substitue CL                |
   | I        | ^i    | Insert at SOL               |
   | A        | $a    | Append at EOL               |

** Scanning
*** f = scan line for next instance of char
*** F = scan line for previous instance of char
*** t = scan line until next instance of char 
*** T = scane line until previous instance of char
*** / = scan document for pattern
*** ? = scan document backwards for pattern   
*** s/foo/bar/g = sed-like substitution
*** qx{changes}q = create a macro

** Make commands repeatable
*** ; = repeat the last f/F/t/T command
*** , = repeat the last f/F/t/T command backwards

    #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
var foo = "method("+argument1+","+argument2+")";
//f+s" + "<ESC>;.;.;.
//or with ex: s/\+/ \+ /g
var foo = "method(" + argument1 + "," + argument2 + ")";
    #+END_SRC
