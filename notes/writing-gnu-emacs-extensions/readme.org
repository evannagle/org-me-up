** (setq <var> <value) => set a variable   
** eval-last-sexp => evaluate sexp before point, print value in echo area
** eval-expression => type expression to be evaluated
** apropos <search> => search documentation   
** describe-key, describe-function, describe-mode   
* Interactive Codes
** [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Interactive-Codes.html#Interactive-Codes][Interactive Codes]] from GNU docs
** Some highlights:
*** p => the prefix passed by C-u <N>
*** P => the raw prefix, returns 1 if null
*** * => throw error if current buffer is read-only

   | X       | A Lisp form's value. ‘X’ reads as ‘x’ does, then evaluates the form so that its value becomes the argument for the command.
